        <p className="info-content">
          Grow a Garden Recipes are special cooking combinations that allow players to transform their harvested crops into delicious dishes.
          Introduced in the Trading and Cooking Event Update, this comprehensive Grow a Garden Recipes system lets you feed Chris P. Bacon (the cooking NPC) with various ingredient
          combinations to create everything from hot dogs to elaborate cakes. Each Grow a Garden Recipes entry requires specific crops grown in your garden, and the
          rarity and size of your ingredients directly impact the quality and rewards of your finished dishes.

        <h2 className="info-title">üç≥ How Grow a Garden Recipes Work</h2>
        <p className="info-content">
          The Grow a Garden Recipes cooking system operates through cooking pots where you combine harvested crops to create specific dishes. To cook, simply approach
          a cooking pot, add your ingredients, and wait for the cooking timer to complete. Each Grow a Garden Recipes entry has a designated cooking time ranging from
          4 to 10 minutes. The magic happens when you feed your cooked dishes to Chris P. Bacon - he has cravings that change every hour, and
          satisfying his specific desires yields significantly better rewards. The Grow a Garden Recipes system rewards experimentation, as discovering new ingredient
          combinations unlocks powerful recipes that can produce prismatic-quality dishes.
